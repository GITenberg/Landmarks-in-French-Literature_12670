description: This 1912 publication is a thoughtful overview of French literature that
  was aimed at illuminating the French classics for English readers. Beginning with
  the Middle Ages and covering the time periods through the end of the nineteenth-century,
  Strachey discusses authors Froissart, Moli re, and Hardy, among others. This readable
  and informative volume remains an ideal introduction to the French classics.
